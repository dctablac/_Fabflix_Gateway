     * So before when we wanted to get the request body
     * we would grab it as a String (String jsonText).
     *
     * The Gateway however does not need to see the body
     * but simply needs to pass it. So we save ourselves some
     * time and overhead by grabbing the request as a byte array
     * (byte[] jsonBytes).
     *
     * This way we can just act as a
     * messenger and just pass along the bytes to the target
     * service and it will do the rest.
     *
     * for example:
     *
     * where we used to do this:
     *
     *     @Path("hello")
     *     ...ect
     *     public Response hello(String jsonString) {
     *         ...ect
     *     }
     *
     * do:
     *
     *     @Path("hello")
     *     ...ect
     *     public Response hello(byte[] jsonBytes) {
     *         ...ect
     *     }
     *
